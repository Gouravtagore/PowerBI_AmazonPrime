Introduction
The goal of this project was to utilize Power BI to create an interactive and insightful dashboard using the Amazon Prime Video dataset from Kaggle. The dashboard provides visual representations of various metrics and trends related to the Amazon Prime Video library.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains comprehensive information about the content available on Amazon Prime Video, including details such as titles, genres, release years, ratings, and more.

Dataset Source: Amazon Prime Video Dataset on Kaggle
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: A business analytics tool used for interactive data visualization and business intelligence.
Kaggle: A platform for data science and machine learning, providing the dataset used in this project.
Data Preparation
Data Extraction:

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle as a CSV file.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Using Power BI, the dataset was imported and cleaned.
Missing values were handled appropriately.
Data types were corrected to ensure accurate analysis.
Additional calculated columns were created to derive new metrics.
Data Modeling:

Relationships between different tables (if any) were established.
The data model was optimized for efficient querying and visualization.
Dashboard Creation
Importing Data into Power BI:

The cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop.
Designing the Dashboard:

Visual elements such as charts, graphs, and tables were added to the dashboard.
Filters and slicers were incorporated to enable interactive exploration of the data.
Layout and design were optimized for a user-friendly experience.


Visualizations:

Bar Charts: Displayed the distribution of content across different genres.
Line Graphs: Showed trends in content release over the years.
Pie Charts: Illustrated the proportion of content by rating.
Tables: Listed detailed information about the top-rated content.
Features
Interactive Filters: Users can filter the data based on various criteria such as genre, release year, and rating.
Dynamic Visualizations: Visual elements update dynamically based on user interactions.
Detailed Insights: Hovering over data points provides additional information and insights.
Usage
Opening the Dashboard:

Open the Power BI Desktop application.
Load the Power BI file (.pbix) containing the dashboard.
Interacting with the Dashboard:

Use filters and slicers to explore different aspects of the dataset.
Hover over visual elements to view detailed insights.
Click on data points to drill down into specific information.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to transform raw data into meaningful insights through interactive dashboards. By leveraging the Amazon Prime Video dataset from Kaggle, I was able to create a comprehensive visualization tool that provides valuable insights into the content library of Amazon Prime Video. The dashboard enables users to explore trends, distributions, and detailed information about the available content.
